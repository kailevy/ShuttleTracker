<div style='padding:1em 30em 0em 30em'><p1 align='center'>We are Team Silent Panthers, students in Olin's Products and Markets class. We are attempting to track the BOW shuttle through a collaborative community effort, so participation if vital. When you see the BOW shuttle or get on/off the shuttle, please post its location, not only to help those wanting to know the shuttle's location, but also to help us gather information. We plan on continuing to improve this app, but only if we can prove that our concept is effective and desirable, so don't hesitate to <a href='mailto:bowshuttle@gmail.com'>send feedback!</a></p1></div>
